The input arguments are

	-h, --help            show this help message and exit
	-i INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE

EXAMPLE
=======


Executing 

	run PyPolII.py -i Data/ACTN1.txt -l 105244 -s 123

will run the model using data of pol-II occupancy for the ACTN1 gene for 5 segments 
and compute the delays of the segments. A figure of the inferred profiles, a file 
with the delays and a file with the computed transcription speed are generated. Examples are contained in the Results folder. The transcription speed is computed from the segment delays using a linear regression through the origin as described in the paper. In this case the computed speed is *2.8 kilobases per second*. This result is also displayed on the command line as 
	
	ACTN1 2.8 kilobases per second



Input Format
------------

The input file contains the average RNA Pol-II occupancy in reads per million (RPM) over the different gene segments.
For each gene segment, the time series of pol-II occupancy is stored as a column vector. The example file *ACTN1.txt* 
contains the data 
	
	Time	Segment 1	Segment 2	Segment 3	Segment 4	Segment 5

	 0	3.07168506	1.44841574	1.30610211	1.28456781	1.17783258
	 5	4.50312281	2.27195979	1.36380291      1.29378391    	1.24780128
	 ...
	 320    3.71889119	1.77794631	1.65309992	1.63749413	1.76234051

Where the first column contains the time at which the measurements were taken and the remaining 5 columns are the time
series of pol-II occupancy for the 5 gene segments.


Parallel Execution
==================

To allow for the processing of a large number of genes, the program *ParPyPolII.py* allows parallel execution.
This program requires the *IPython.parallel* module which is dependant on 

1. pyzmq
2. tornado

These can be installed by typing

	sudo pip install pyzmq tornado

To run the code in parallel, we must first start a controller and a number of engines by typing for example

	$ ipcluster start -n 4

which starts 4 engines.
 
We can then run our program in the *Ipython* shell by typing

	run ParPyPolII.py [-h] -i GENE_LIST -d DATA_DIR -o OUT_DIR [-n NUM_TRY]
                     [-t TRANS] [-s RND_SEED]

The input arguments are 

	-h, --help            show this help message and exit
	-i GENE_LIST, --gene_list GENE_LIST
		        Properly formatted input file containing gene names
		        and gene lengths. For each gene, the corresponding
		        data should be in the input data directory with the
		        name <gene name>.txt
	-d DATA_DIR, --data_dir DATA_DIR
		        The complete path of the directory containing properly
		        formatted data.
	-o OUT_DIR, --out_dir OUT_DIR
		        The complete path of the output directory to store
		        program output. The outputs are a plot of the inferred
		        pol-II segment profiles, <gene name>.pdf, a text file
		        with the delays of each segment <gene name_delay>.txt
		        and a text file with the gene transcription speed in
		        kilobases per second <gene name_speed>.txt.
	-n NUM_TRY, --num_try NUM_TRY
		        Number of random initializations when performing
		        maximum likelihood optimization
	-t TRANS, --trans TRANS
		        Parameter transformation flag. When true, the
		        parameters are transformed using a logit function
		        before optimization.
	-s RND_SEED, --rnd_seed RND_SEED
		        Random Seed


The file *GENE_LIST* contains a list of genes to be processed as well as their lengths in base pairs separated by a tab (see *gene_list.txt*). For example

	TPM1	22196
	WDR1	42611

For each of the genes in the list, the input data in the format shown above is located in the data directory *DATA_DIR*.

Executing 
	
	run ParPyPolII.py -i gene_list.txt  -d /home/.../Data/ -o /home/.../Results/  -s 123

will run the model for the genes in *gene_list.txt* on the parallel engines. We assume that the file containing definitions for the convolved Gaussian processes (*conv_gp_funcs.py*) is located in the current working directory. The results are stored in the output directory.
